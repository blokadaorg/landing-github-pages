<h4><a name="refresh">Blokada가 적게 광고를 차단합니다.</a></h4>
<p>Blokada가 이전보다 광고를 적게 차지하는 것으로 의심되면 목록을 새로 고침하십시오. 이를 수행하려면 <i>블랙리스트</i>를 탭한 다음 이퀄라이저의 오른쪽 상단 모서리에서 <i>필터 새로 고침</i>을 선택하고 <i>계속</i>을 탭하십시오. 일반적으로 새로운 서버가 블랙리스트에 아직 식별되지 않고 추가 된 기존 서버에 추가되거나 새 목록이 사용자의 휴대 전화로 다운로드되지 않기 때문에 발생합니다. 따라서 (아직) 차단되지 않았습니다.<br> <i>블랙리스트</i> 메뉴에서 더 많은 호스트 목록을 활성화하거나 보다 제한적인 필터를 추가 할 수 있습니다.</p>

<p>Blokada는 타사 목록을 사용합니다. 따라서 앱 자체가 이전에 작동하여 광고가 차단 된 경우 변경없이 동일한 방식으로 작동해야합니다.</p>

<h4><a name="whitelist">앱이 예상대로 작동하지 않습니다.</a></h4>
<p>앱이 예상대로 작동하지 않거나 콘텐츠를로드하지 않았거나 유사한 오작동이 발생하는 경우 기본 화면으로 이동하여 화면 하단의 <i>허용 목록</i>을 선택하십시오. + 기호를 탭하고 <i>앱</i>을 선택한 다음 이름을 입력하십시오. 마지막에 <i>저장</i>을 탭하십시오. 이를 통해 Blokada는이 앱의 URL을 필터링하지 않습니다.</p>

<p>Blokada 3.4 및 이전 버전에는 새로 설치 한 앱이 Blokada에서 인식되지 않는 버그가 있었기 때문에 <i>허용 목록</i>에 설정할 수 없었습니다. 이 버그는 버전 3.5 이상에서 수정되었습니다.</p>

<h4><a name="blacklist">주어진 웹 사이트를 차단하고 싶습니다.</a></h4>
<p>You can block individual website what isn't on a host list. To do it, go to the <i>Blacklist</i> on the main page, tap on the + sign at the bottom of the screen, tap on <i>Host</i> and type in the hostname of the website, without the http and www part (for example: <i>myexample.com</i>).</p>

<h4><a name="youtube">YouTube의 광고가 차단되지 않았습니다!</a></h4>
<p>Blocking ads on YT is very hard because Google uses encryption and randomly generated hosts to serve the ads. Therefore, it's much easier to block ads within the YT app as with an external tool (like Blokada). NewPipe and YouTube Vanced are featureful, great alternatives of the official YouTube application, please check which fits better for you.</p>

<h4><a name="unsupported">Blokada를 설치 한 후에는 시작할 수 없습니다.</a></h4>
<p>There are two common causes for such a situation. First, please check if you have an active VPN connection and if thats <i>Always-on VPN</i> option is enabled. To do it, go to the Settings of your phone, search for VPN in the network section, tap on the gear next to the existing VPN. Disable it, disconnect from the active VPN connection and try to restart Blokada.</p>

<p>If you don’t have other VPN connection, check in Blokada if <i>Watchdog</i> is enabled in the Advanced Settings, and if yes, check if you are connected to the internet either with wifi or with mobile data. Blokada won’t start if the <i>Watchdog</i> is enabled and you don’t have an active internet connection.</p>

<p>If it doesn’t help, restart your phone, it also helps sometimes.</p>

<h4><a name="kill">Blokada는 잠시 후 기능/작동을 멈 춥니 다.</a></h4>
<p>As a first step, turn on <i>Keep alive</i> in Blokada. In this case, Blokada will try to stay online, but please note, your system still can effect this behaviour. If you set it, and you still see that Blokada is stopped time after time, check your system’s settings and turn off every battery- and memory-optimisation for Blokada. Unfortunately it is different in every system, therefore we cannot say where to do it. Please check your phone’s settings. Other source of such behaviour can be that you are using a memory cleaner. Please set Blokada on whitelist or exclude list. If non of this steps helped in your case, please report a bug (see below how to do it).</p>

<h4><a name="abplists">Blokada에 EasyList/AdBlock Plus 목록을 가져올 수 없습니다.</a></h4>
<p>If you try to import a list (for example EasyList) that works very well with your AdBlock Plus extension on your PC or notebook, Blokada will report an error message. It is because Blokada uses other method to block ads. While ABP blocks and hides elements or parts of the website, Blokada cannot do it because it's not a plugin in the browser, instead it redirects the accesses to the ad-server to a non-routable address (0.0.0.0), therefore it needs a hostname-IP list.</p>

<h4><a name="howitworks">Blokada는 어떻게 작동합니까?</a></h4>
<p>Blokada is a thin layer between the network interface (wifi or mobile) of your phone and the application/s you use. To be able to filter every outgoing traffic, it generates a local (no 3rd party service in use) VPN connection and simply blocks any requests towards the hosts defined in the blacklist filters. This blocking is done with a redirection, the IP address of the website that serves the advertisement will be resolved by the phone to a non-routable meta-address, for 0.0.0.0, where no web service is running, therefore nothing will be shown. With this, Blokada saves both your data plan and battery life. The filters are updated automatically and contain hosts known for serving ads, tracking, spam, malware, and other unwanted or dangerous content. You can configure Blokada with your own custom filters and whitelists to ensure the service that you would like to use isn’t blocked and you don’t experience any interruption.</p>

<h4><a name="vpn">Blokada가 켜져있는 동안 다른 VPN을 사용할 수 있습니까?</a></h4>
<p>Unfortunately no, it is a system limitation; you can have only one active VPN connection at a time. If you join to an other service, Blokada will exit.</p>

<h4><a name="options">Blokada의 옵션은 무엇입니까?</a></h4>
<p>As you surely saw it, Blokada has some options on the main screen that are not detailed at the first start. Please let us do it now. You can see the following:</p>
<p><ul>
    <li><b>Blacklist</b>: this is the lists of host files containing the servers to block. Please note that using multiple lists can have effect on network and system speed.</li>
    <li><b>Whitelist</b>: the whitelist is the exception list, here you can define hosts that should not be blocked or apps where Blokada won’t filter URLs. Blokada is installed with several whitelisted apps by default.</li>
    <li><b>Keep alive</b>: this option is to ensure Blokada is not paused or stopped by the system. Please note your system can overwrite it, make sure your settings will let Blokada run in the background.</li>
    <li><b>Notifications</b>: when enabled, you will be notified when an ad is blocked. It is on by default, but if you get a lot of notifications, turn it off.</li>
    <li><b>Watchdog</b>: when enabled, Blokada will exit if there is no active connection, and start again whenever connection comes back. If disabled, Blokada will always run in the background (even if no network is available). Please note this option may not work on every device.</li>
    <li><b>Start on boot</b>: when enabled, Blokada will start after the system boots up. Please note there are system level configurations for this option, therefore it cannot be guaranteed Blokada can start on boot. In this case, please check your phone’s settings. The default configuration is enabled, if you want to start Blokada manually, disable this option.</li>
    <li><b>DNS</b>: if you are suspecting that some websites or services are blocked for you, or you are presuming that your internet provider collects information about your intenet usage, choose a secure DNS machine from the list. By default, Blokada uses the same DNS server/s as your system.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Not configurable things:</p>
<p><ul>
    <li><b>Up to date</b>: if you see it, you are running the most recent version of Blokada. Keep the app up-to-date because it has less bugs and more features!</li>
    <li><b># ads blocked</b>: the number of unwanted content that Blokada blocked since it is started for the first time</li>
    <li><b># hosts</b>: number of servers that serves advertisements, malware and other unwanted content</li>
</ul></p>

<h4><a name="ads">광고가 계속 표시되면 어떻게해야합니까?</a></h4>
<p>Some ads will come through with any ad blocker on Android. In particular YouTube ads or some fullscreen popup ads are difficult to block. If you think more ads are coming through than before, try these steps:</p>
<p><ul>
    <li>Check if the VPN key icon is present in the status bar at the top. If not, start Blokada.</li>
    <li>Open Blokada and check if it is active and not reporting any errors.</li>
    <li>Check if the hosts counter is not equal to zero. If it is, select some blacklist filters so that ads can be blocked. If the counter is still zero, grant storage access permission in the System Settings - Applications - Blokada, then clear data and cache and reboot the device.</li>
    <li>Make sure you don't have too many apps in the whitelist - maybe that's why you are seeing ads.</li>
    <li>Try resetting your filters (go to the Blacklist screen and choose <i>Restore Defaults</i> from the Quick Actions menu at the top).</li>
    <li>If you see ads in your browser, deactivate any kind of traffic compression or optimisation in the browser's settings.</li>
    <li>Deactivate Blokada, close it (by swiping it out from the Recents screen), and turn it on again.</li>
    <li>If you recently changed your settings (filters, whitelist, etc), remember it takes time before new configuration start working. Give it some time.</li>
    <li>Clear app data for Blokada (in system settings), or reinstall it.</li>
    <li>Restart your device.</li>
    <li>Your device may be unsupported. Please check <a href="http://go.blokada.org/issue_device">Devices Database</a>.</li>
    <li>If none of those steps helped, please report a bug (see below).</li>
</ul></p>

 <h4><a name="DNS">DNS 란 무엇이며 어떤 것을 선택해야합니까?</a></h4>
 <p>The acronym DNS stands for Domain Name System and this servers are responsible to resolve the domain names (for example: <i>myexample.com</i>) to IP addresses, what are used between machines to communicate. Your internet service provider has its own DNS servers; Blokada is configured to use the system defaults. The machines in this list should be used if you are suspecting that your ISP collects logs about your internet usage, you are afraid of some privacy risk or if some websites or services are blocked for you. There is no "best", everything depends on your preferences and location, therefore if you would like to use custom DNS servers, please read their description, search for them on the internet and read the feedbacks.</p>

<h4><a name="update">I cannot install an update, what can I do?</a></h4>
<p>First of all, please check if the Android version you have is 5 or newer. Android 4 and older versions are not supported in Blokada 3.0 and newer versions. To do it, go to the Settings of your phone, scroll to <i>About phone</i> and search for <i>Android version</i></p>
<p>If your phone runs Andriod 5 or newer, please restart your device. It sounds strange, but sometimes it helps. If that didn't solve the issue, uninstall Blokada and install it again. It can be, that your device is unsupported. Please check <a href="http://go.blokada.org/issue_device">Devices Database</a>.</p>
<p>If none of those steps helped, please join to our Telegram chat on <a href="http://go.blokada.org/chat">go.blokada.org/chat</a> to get help, or report a bug (see below).</p>

<h4><a name="notification">Can I hide the VPN notification?</a></h4>
<p>Unfortunately no. Some devices may be displaying annoying VPN notification (a key icon) while VPN is active, and it is not possible to hide it. If you can, try updating your device to Android 8 (Oreo), since newer Android versions do not have this status report.</p>

<h4><a name="bug">How do I report an issue, idea or suggestion?</a></h4>
<p>If you are experiencing problems, please join to our Telegram chat at <a href="http://go.blokada.org/chat">go.blokada.org/chat</a>, where our community is happy to help you.

Please provide as much information as you can and steps to reproduce the same issue - it helps greatly in fixing your problem! If you are a pro user, you can go directly to the issue tracker at GitHub.</p>

<h4><a name="private">Can Blokada see my private data?</a></h4>
<p>No. Blokada does not read or tamper with your private information, it only monitors which hosts your device is making requests towards and blocks the ones matching the filters. Every time Blokada blocks anything, you will see a notification (what you can turn off). Blokada has no access to your encrypted traffic.</p>

<h4><a name="battery">Does Blokada use a lot of battery?</a></h4>
<p>No. Depending on your settings the battery impact is minimal, and on most new devices, especially on Marshmallow (Android 6) or newer, you will not notice any battery drain. However, some unlucky devices may experience increased battery drain. Refer to the <a href="http://go.blokada.org/issue_device">Devices Database</a> for details.</p>

<h4><a name="speed">Will Blokada slow down my device?</a></h4>
<p>No. Depending on your settings Blokada can be quite efficient. In fact, both your device's performance and battery life may visibly improve, because Blokada saves your device from downloading and processing content you don't need or care about. However, users with some older devices may experience performance drop. Refer to the <a href="http://go.blokada.org/issue_device">Devices Database</a> for details.</p>

<h4><a name="free">Is Blokada really free to use?</a></h4>
<p>Yes! Blokada started as my hobby project, is still mostly developed by me. It's my way of giving back to the community. Blokada is fully open source and it will stay free forever. That said, developing it takes a lot of time, so please consider supporting the project in any way you can (see below).</p>

<h4><a name="contribute">Blokada is great, how can I help the project?</a></h4>
<p>There are many ways to support Blokada, financially or else. All means of help are very important for the project to exist. <a href="contribute.html">Please go to this page for more information</a>, or just <a href="http://go.blokada.org/chat">join our chat</a>.</p>
